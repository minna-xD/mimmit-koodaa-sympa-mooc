Population Graph created in the MOOC course by Sympa: [Web Coding for Beginners](https://sympaoy.github.io/webcodingforbeginners/).

Got the course certificate on April 2, 2020.

Before the course I knew HTML and CSS but hadn't really done much with JavaScript (apart from little code snippets I used in onClick attributes decades ago). It was really interesting to learn how to use open data through an API (World Bank). [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) was a nice visualization library to use, too.

This little course lured me into learning more JavaScript because it bothered me how little I was able to customize the code itself.
